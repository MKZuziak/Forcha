- Mode: Fed_Opt
- Task: FMNIST learning
- Model: Expanded CNN.
- Clients: 3
- Sample: 3
- Round: 20
- Detects: general correctness, memory leaks.
- Machine: eltractor.isti.cnr.it

Results [23.09.2023, v. 0.1.4.4]: All seems correct, model training is more or less stable, gpu memory does not leak.
Backlog [23.09.2023, v. 0.1.4.4]: Strange behaviour observed: training may hold and lock during multiprocessing 
stage. So far, I lack explanation. Maybe it is due to th hardware limitations.
