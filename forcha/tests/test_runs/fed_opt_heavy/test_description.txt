Results [23.09.2023, v. 0.1.4.4]: All seems correct, model training is more or less stable, gpu memory does not leak.
Backlog [23.09.2023, v. 0.1.4.4]: Strange behaviour observed: training may hold and lock during multiprocessing 
stage. So far, I lack explanation. Maybe it is due to th hardware limitations.
Log [25.09.2023, v. 0.1.4.4]: Strange behaviour was eliminated after updating all the libraries (PyTorch to 2.0.1) and
